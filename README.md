# StatsParser

This is a small little tool I used to run a bit of analysis on some data I collected from a minigame I created for a discord bot I host. The way this minigame worked, users would collect "gems" of different rarities and qualities to get points, and they could spend points on upgrades as well as on a simple gambling game. Over the course of the main life of this game (as it was an April Fools event, the data in `log.txt` is from April 1st to April 3rd) I logged all game activity.
